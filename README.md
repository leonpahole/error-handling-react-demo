# Error handling React demo

This repo showcases improved error handling that I use, which is described in [this blog post](https://www.leonpahole.com/blog/how-i-handle-frontend-errors). For reference, standard error handling is also implemented.

## Setup

Install dependencies:

```bash
yarn
```

Run:

```bash
yarn dev
```
